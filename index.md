Title: Best Hosting Service
*/

## How to choose a hosting service for your website?

- There are a lot of free and paid hosting services out there. Sometimes it gets a little hard to choose which one is right for you, so in this blog, I will let you know which one is good for you and the benefits.

## What I use
I personally use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) most of the time, but I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) sometimes.


## What Should You Use?
 FREE SERVICES:
  - If you just want to deploy your HTML, CSS, JS to a website, I highly suggest using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

  - If you want to deploy Flask, or something of that sort, you can use [Heroku](herokuapp.com) and I also believe you can use [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

 PAID SERVICES:
   - If you want to go with the paid option, there are many out there. I haven't really gotten into PAID hosting, so you can [check this article out](https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/)
